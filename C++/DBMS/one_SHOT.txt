Chapter 1 
    ü§©
    Data : Means nothing meaning store in computer in the form collection of bits/bytes

    Informations : data has meaning and process in the computer to interpert
    
    DBMS : It is set of irrealtive data store and code to access that data (Create Read Update Delete)


    DBMS vs File System 
    üßë‚Äçüíª Data Storage : DBMS stores data in a structured way with relationships between tables, while the file system stores 
                      data in unstructured files.
    üßë‚Äçüíª Data Integrity: DBMS ensures data integrity through ACID properties, whereas the file system lacks built-in integrity 
                       constraints.
    üßë‚Äçüíª Data Security: DBMS offers robust security features like user authentication and access control; 
                      the file system provides limited security options.


    ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    Note :
    ACID : ACID keeps data safe, organized, and correct, like making sure toys are always handled properly in a toy box.
    Atomicity Consistency Isolation and Durability



Chapter 2 
    ü§©
    Abstraction : It is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential functionalities 
                  to the user. For example, a car allows you to drive without understanding its internal mechanics.

    View : Table whose rows are not explicitly stored, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

    Schema : Nothing but desgin of table columns (Name , Phone , Address , Height , Weight , IBM , etc) / overall design.
  
    Instance of DB : What information is stored at paticular moment of time.


    ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    What is meaning of all above defination ? 
    => Suppose you are working in amazon as DBMS engg and logistic department wants - (Name , Address , Phone No) & 
        Customer Service wanst - (Name , Address , Phone , Product Details).  
        
        Abstraction + View = Hiding the irrealtive data and craete the virtual table by using view to diaply the paticular data.


    üßë‚Äçüíª There are 3 levels of Data is Store and Retrive means inshort viewing of data.

        a. Physical Level : This is lowest level of abstraction , it means how the data is store in physical storage and end goal is 
                            by using algo that allows effcient "access" to data.

        b. Logical Level (DB Schema) : It is conceptual view means what the data is and relationships btw other data and DBA decide what the data is been shown and what not.

        c. View Level (Subschema): Highest Level of abstraction and end goal is to show the realtive data to user.
